                        Earth 🌍 is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. It has a unique structure, composed of several layers. At its core, Earth has a dense, hot center made primarily of iron and nickel, surrounded by a molten outer core. Above this is the mantle, made of silicate rocks rich in magnesium and iron, which flows slowly over millions of years. The outermost layer is the crust, a thin, solid surface where life exists. This dynamic structure contributes to geological activity, including earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

                        Earth’s rotation period is approximately 24 hours, which causes the cycle of day and night. It orbits the Sun in about 365.25 days, creating our annual calendar. The slight extra time accounts for leap years every four years. Earth’s axis is tilted at 23.5 degrees, leading to the seasonal changes as the planet moves around the Sun.
                        
                        Gravity on Earth is 9.8 m/s², a force strong enough to hold the atmosphere in place. This atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases. Oxygen allows for respiration, while nitrogen is essential for life processes. Earth’s atmosphere also protects us from harmful solar and cosmic radiation, aided by the magnetic field generated by the molten outer core. This field deflects solar winds and cosmic rays, making Earth a hospitable environment for life.
                        
                        Water, in all three states—liquid, solid, and gas—covers about 71% of Earth’s surface, making it a “blue planet.” Its ability to sustain diverse ecosystems and regulate climate makes Earth unique among planets in the solar system, ensuring it remains a vibrant, life-supporting world.

                    <div class="title">MOON</div>
                    <div class="topic">EARTH'S MOON </div>
                    <div class="des">
                        Earth’s Moon is the fifth largest natural satellite in the solar system and Earth’s only natural satellite. It has a rocky composition, with a core made of iron and a mantle composed of silicate materials. Its surface is marked by craters, mountains, and large, flat plains known as “maria,” formed from ancient volcanic activity. The Moon lacks a significant atmosphere, meaning its surface is exposed to extreme temperatures, ranging from 127°C (260°F) during the day to -173°C (-280°F) at night.

                          The Moon’s rotation period is synchronous with its orbit around Earth, both taking approximately 27.3 days. This is why the same side of the Moon always faces Earth, a phenomenon known as “tidal locking.” The time between full moons, known as the lunar cycle, is about 29.5 days due to Earth’s own movement around the Sun.

                         The Moon’s gravitational force is about 1/6th that of Earth’s, at 1.62 m/s², which significantly affects Earth’s tides. Its gravity pulls on Earth’s oceans, causing the regular rise and fall of tides.

                         Unlike Earth, the Moon has no magnetic field or atmosphere to protect it from cosmic radiation and meteoroids. Despite this, the Moon plays a crucial role in stabilizing Earth’s axial tilt, which helps regulate the planet’s climate over long periods. Its proximity and visibility have made it a focal point of human observation and exploration throughout history.

                    <div class="title">THE RED PALNET MARS</div>
                    <div class="topic">PALNET </div>
                    <div class="des">Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is a cold, rocky world often called the “Red Planet” due to its iron oxide-rich surface, which gives it a reddish appearance. It has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide (95.3%), with traces of nitrogen and argon. Mars has surface features similar to both Earth and the Moon, including valleys, volcanoes, and impact craters. Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system, is located on Mars.

                        A day on Mars, called a “sol,” lasts about 24.6 hours, making its day slightly longer than Earth’s. It takes Mars approximately 687 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun, giving it nearly twice the length of an Earth year. Mars also experiences seasons due to its axial tilt of 25.2°, similar to Earth’s.
                        
                        Mars’ gravity is weaker than Earth’s, at about 3.7 m/s², which affects its ability to retain a thicker atmosphere. Despite its harsh, cold desert-like conditions, with average surface temperatures around -60°C (-80°F), Mars has been a prime target for exploration due to the potential discovery of water ice and evidence of past liquid water, making it a candidate for future human exploration and colonization.

                    <div class="des">
                        Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, is the largest planet in the solar system, often called a “gas giant.” Composed mainly of hydrogen (around 90%) and helium (10%), Jupiter lacks a solid surface. Instead, it has a thick atmosphere with swirling clouds and storms, including the famous Great Red Spot, a massive storm system larger than Earth that has raged for centuries.

                        Jupiter’s rotation period is the fastest among all planets, completing a full spin in just under 10 hours. However, its orbit around the Sun takes about 12 Earth years. Despite its rapid rotation, Jupiter’s strong gravity, at 24.79 m/s² (about 2.5 times that of Earth’s), helps it retain a massive atmosphere.
                        
                        The planet is surrounded by faint rings and hosts at least 79 moons, with four large ones—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—called the Galilean moons. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, even bigger than Mercury.
                        
                        Jupiter’s immense size and mass create an intense magnetic field, more than 20,000 times stronger than Earth’s. This powerful field traps particles, creating radiation belts that pose a challenge for spacecraft. Despite its inhospitable conditions, Jupiter plays a crucial role in protecting inner planets from asteroid impacts due to its gravitational influence.
