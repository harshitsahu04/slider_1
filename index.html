                    <div class="topic">PLANET</div>
                    <div class="des">Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, is a small and rocky world characterized by extreme temperature fluctuations. With a diameter of about 3,032 miles (4,880 kilometers), it is the smallest planet in the solar system. Mercury has a thin atmosphere, which is insufficient to retain heat, causing daytime temperatures to soar to around 800°F (427°C) while plunging to nearly -330°F (-201°C) at night. The planet’s surface is marked by craters, similar to Earth’s Moon, due to its lack of protective atmosphere. Mercury’s year is shorter than its day; it takes only 88 Earth days to complete an orbit around the Sun but rotates on its axis once every 59 Earth days. The planet has no moons, and its swift orbit creates a unique phenomenon where it appears to move backward in the sky at times, known as retrograde motion. Despite its inhospitable conditions, Mercury offers valuable insights into planetary formation and evolution, making it a target for scientific exploration.

                    <div class="des">Venus, often referred to as Earth’s “sister planet” due to its similar size and proximity, is the second planet from the Sun and is known for its thick, toxic atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. With a diameter of about 7,520 miles (12,104 kilometers), it is nearly the same size as Earth. Venus has a surface temperature averaging around 900°F (475°C), making it the hottest planet in the solar system, primarily due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Its surface features include vast plains, volcanic mountains, and some of the largest volcanoes in the solar system. Venus rotates very slowly on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete a single rotation, which is longer than its orbital period of 225 Earth days. Interestingly, Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, causing the Sun to rise in the west and set in the east. The planet’s thick clouds reflect about 70% of sunlight, giving it a bright appearance from Earth, where it is often visible just before dawn or after sunset.</div>

                    <div class="title">MOON</div>
                    <div class="topic">EARTH'S MOON</div>
                    <div class="des">Earth’s Moon is the fifth largest natural satellite in the solar system and Earth’s only natural satellite. It has a rocky composition, with a core made of iron and a mantle composed of silicate materials. Its surface is marked by craters, mountains, and large, flat plains known as “maria,” formed from ancient volcanic activity. The Moon lacks a significant atmosphere, meaning its surface is exposed to extreme temperatures, ranging from 127°C (260°F) during the day to -173°C (-280°F) at night.

                        The Moon’s rotation period is synchronous with its orbit around Earth, both taking approximately 27.3 days. This is why the same side of the Moon always faces Earth, a phenomenon known as “tidal locking.” The time between full moons, known as the lunar cycle, is about 29.5 days due to Earth’s own movement around the Sun.
                        
                        The Moon’s gravitational force is about 1/6th that of Earth’s, at 1.62 m/s², which significantly affects Earth’s tides. Its gravity pulls on Earth’s oceans, causing the regular rise and fall of tides.
                        
                        Unlike Earth, the Moon has no magnetic field or atmosphere to protect it from cosmic radiation and meteoroids. Despite this, the Moon plays a crucial role in stabilizing Earth’s axial tilt, which helps regulate the planet’s climate over long periods. Its proximity and visibility have made it a focal point of human observation and exploration throughout history.</div>

                    <div class="topic">PLANET</div>
                    <div class="des">Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the “Red Planet” due to its reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide, or rust, on its surface. With a diameter of about 4,220 miles (6,779 kilometers), Mars is roughly half the size of Earth. The planet has a thin atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with only trace amounts of oxygen and water vapor, making it inhospitable for human life. Mars features the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which stands nearly 13.6 miles (22 kilometers) high, and a vast canyon system called Valles Marineris, which stretches over 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometers). Evidence suggests that Mars once had liquid water on its surface, and researchers are actively exploring the possibility of past microbial life. The planet experiences seasons similar to Earth due to its axial tilt and has polar ice caps that grow and recede with the changing seasons. Mars is a prime target for future exploration and potential colonization, with numerous missions aimed at uncovering its mysteries.</div>

                    <div class="des">Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, is a gas giant with a diameter of about 86,881 miles (139,822 kilometers), more than 11 times that of Earth. Its massive atmosphere consists mostly of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of methane, ammonia, and other gases. One of Jupiter’s most distinctive features is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm larger than Earth that has persisted for centuries. The planet has a strong magnetic field and emits more energy than it receives from the Sun, likely due to internal heat generated from its massive size and gravitational compression. Jupiter has at least 79 known moons, including the four largest, known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Each of these moons exhibits unique characteristics; for example, Europa is believed to have a subsurface ocean, making it a candidate for potential extraterrestrial life. Jupiter’s rapid rotation—completing a rotation in just under 10 hours—creates powerful winds and storms, contributing to its dynamic and ever-changing atmosphere.</div>
